# AXI Architecture #
AXI is referred to as Adbanced eXtensible Interface and is an interface protocol. This is defined by ARM as part of the AMBA (Advanced Microntroller Bus Architecture) standard

**AXI Interface**
. AXI data transfer protocol is burst-based. Burst is nothing but a sequence of data which are going to be transferred at a time at the edge of the clock. That means you con transfer multiple data sequence or stream at a particular clock edge. Every transaction has address and control information on the address channel that describes the nature of the data to be transferred.
