# Up/Down Counter (Verilog)

## Overview
This project implements a **parameterized digital counter** in Verilog with **up/down counting**, **enable**, and **synchronous reset**. It's part of the **DSP-to-RTL** series, where I take hardware building blocks from concept to synthesizable RTL Verilog code and verified testbenches.

## Features
- **Configurable width** (4-bits)
- **Up or Down counting** via control input
- **Enable** signal to pause counting
- **Synchronous Reset** for predictable startup
- Clean, synthesizable RTL
