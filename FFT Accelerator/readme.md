**FFT Accelerator on ZYNQ ARM Processor**
This repository contains the architecture overview of ZYNQ SoC and the design procedure to program the ARM processor to communicate over UART (or JTAG) using Hello World and FFT examples. The FFT is coded with the C programming language using the AMD Xilnx Vitis HLS tool. 
* We used Vivado 2020.2 version to design the FFT hardware and Vitis 2020.2 to code the software application.
* Topics explored in this repository:
  - ZYNQ architecture
  - Create a Vivado project
  - Use Vitis HLS to create C-based applications on an ARM processor
  - Debugging of the software design
