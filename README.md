# DSP-to-RTL
This repository contains a collection of wireless digital signal processing (DSP) projects taken all the way from Matlab/Python models to working RTL on FPGA. It includes DSP building blocks like FIR filter with fixed-point conversion, bit-true verification, and FPGA timing/power results-showing the full path from algorithm-to-hardware.

**Algorithm-to-Fixed-point-RTL** 
- Projects focused on wireless communication algorithms
- MATLAB/Python based signal processing algorithms both in floating-point and fixed-point models
- Synthesizable Register-Transfer Level (RTL) Verilog coding for hardware implementation on FPGA
- Timing, power, and resource usage reports and analysis using synthesis tools like Vivado
- Clear microarchitecture diagrams and short descriptions
