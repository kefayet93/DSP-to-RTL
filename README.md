# DSP-to-RTL
This repository contains a collection of wireless digital signal processing (DSP) projects taken all the way from Matlab/Python models to working RTL on FPGA. It includes DSP building blocks like FIR filter with fixed-point conversion, bit-true verification, and FPGA timing/power results-showing the full path from algorithm-to-hardware.
