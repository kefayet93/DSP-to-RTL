**Register Allocation**
For example, we have 14 variables. Now the question we have to answer is, do we need 14 registers to store these 14 variables, or less number of registers store these 14 variables?
The answer is that we don't need 14 registers to store these 14 variables. That is the maximum possible hardware utilization, which is not the best possible hardware design. Now, given these variables and the available schedule, the problem we need to solve is to identify the minimum number of registers required to execute this behavior or store these variables in the registers. This is referred to as register allocation. 

For example, let's assume we need 10 registers. The question is again the Binding problem. We have 14 variables, which register will store which variable and at what time. So, once the scheduling is done, the next two problems are the "Functional Unit Allocation" and "Register Binding" problems. That is how we realize the datapath, i.e., the actual hardware. After scheduling, we only know that we need 43 clock cycles. The next job is to determine the resources to realize the operation. Resource is basically of two types, functional units and registers. Registers store the variable and functional unit to execute the operations.
