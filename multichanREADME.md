# Multichannel Filtering
A multichannel FIR filter is essentially an array of FIR filters operating simultaneously on different data streams. Each stream has its own data, but often shares the same filter coefficients (e.g., matched filters, anti-aliasing filters, or reconstruction filters).

**A 4-channel FIR Filter** 
- Projects focused on wireless communication algorithms
- MATLAB/Python-based signal processing algorithms, both in floating-point and fixed-point models
- Synthesizable Register-Transfer Level (RTL) Verilog coding for hardware implementation on an FPGA
- Timing, power, and resource usage reports and analysis using synthesis tools like Vivado
- Clear microarchitecture diagrams and short descriptions
